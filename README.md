# Ping pong TDD with Roman Numerals

At 'I Code Java' [Pavel Dabrytski](https://twitter.com/paveldabrytski) and [Rory Preddy](https://twitter.com/rorypreddy) did a great presentation on ping-pong TDD.

I paired (_It was more like rally than ping-pong._) with the brilliant [Steven Ndaye](https://twitter.com/StevenNdaye) and knocked up 
the formatter in about 10-15 minutes and later on added the parser in about 5 minutes.


The following day [Frank Smith](https://twitter.com/OryxGazella) [showed](http://frank.soy/posts/i-code-java-2016.html) us how to use Spock to do the [testing](https://github.com/OryxGazella/pingpongtdd/blob/master/test/RomanConverterSpec.groovy).

Kotlin conversion!!
